**ML News App API**
=====================

**Summerization of My First Machine Learning NLP Project**

This repository contains the API for my first machine learning NLP project, a news aggregator app that fetches news articles from Google News and provides a summary of each article using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

**Features**

* Fetches news articles from Google News based on topic or search query
* Provides a summary of each article using NLP techniques
* Returns news data in JSON format

**Endpoints**

* `/api/news`: Fetches news articles based on topic or search query
	+ Parameters:
		- `topic`: Topic or category of news (e.g. "top", "search", "business", etc.)
		- `query`: Search query for news articles (required for "search" topic)
		- `quantity`: Number of news articles to return (default: 5)

**Implementation**

The API is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and utilizes the following libraries:

* `newspaper`: For fetching and parsing news articles
* `nltk`: For natural language processing and summarization
* `BeautifulSoup`: For parsing HTML content

**Frontend**

The frontend for this API is built using React and can be found at [https://github.com/manishraj27/ml-news-app-frontend](https://github.com/manishraj27/ml-news-app-frontend).

**Running the API**

To run the API, simply execute the following commands in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/news`.

**Note**

This is my first machine learning NLP project, and I'm excited to share it with the community. I'm open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve the API and its functionality.
